okay so i'm trying to make it so when the item is dragged over the lip of the bag, the bag z-index changes to be on TOP of the item so it looks like its going in ONLY WHEN its being dragged over the top. I don't know how to do that, it's making my brain hurt lol.
Here's the sites I'm using as references:

A mouseover event might be easier to do?

I don't know if I should change the z-index of the bag walls, or maybe just them item? I'm not good with javascript

okay so probably changing the zindex of the item to be BELOW the bag walls ONLY WHEN it touches the top of the bag.
